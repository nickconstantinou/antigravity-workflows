# Workflow: Refactor & Align

This workflow is a wrapper around the **Refactoring Skill**. Run this command to learn the "Monolith First" principle, Proximity Test, and Header protocols.

## Instructions
1.  Read the skill documentation:
    ```bash
    cat .agent/skills/refactoring/SKILL.md
    ```
2.  Follow the **Discovery**, **Analysis**, and **Execution** steps defined there.
3.  Ensure your refactor passes the **Quad Gate**.
