**Context**: User is a Technical Product Manager. They know *how* to build apps, but want to understand the *why* behind architectural patterns.

**Goal**: Explain the concept at three depths to build intuition.

## 1️⃣ Level 1: The "Elevator Pitch" (The What & Why)
* **Concept**: What is this pattern called?
* **Problem**: What pain does it solve?
* **Analogy**: A simple real-world comparison.

## 2️⃣ Level 2: The "Mechanics" (The How)
* **Implementation**: How does it work in *our* codebase specifically?
* **Code Walkthrough**: Point to the specific lines where this happens.
* **The "Gotcha"**: What is the most annoying thing about using this pattern?

## 3️⃣ Level 3: The "CTO View" (The Trade-offs)
* **Scaling**: Does this break at 10k users? 1M users?
* **Cost**: Is this computationally expensive?
* **Alternatives**: Why did we choose this over X? (e.g., "Why Postgres RLS over App-level logic?")

**Tone**: Professional peer-to-peer. No "Listen here student." Use "We/Us."

**Next Step:**
*   Return to the **Active Epoch** to continue building or auditing.
